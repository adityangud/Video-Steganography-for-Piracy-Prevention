    <h1> JOINER </h1>
    <br/>

    <p> Joiner is responsible for joining stego frames in a fashion determined by the input string (Transaction ID) </p>
    <p> A two minute video in frames is around 20 GB. Joiner needs 4 folders 
    <ol>
        <li> Normal folder of frames (unmodified) </li>
        <li> One folder containing frames with increased luminance </li>
        <li> Zero folder containing frames with decreased luminance </li>
        <li> Output folder, where frames from the previous 3 will be joined in some fashion to embed the bitstring </li>
    </ol>

    </p>
    <p> Joiner needs enough space for all of this, and an external HD mounts differently each time </p>
    <p> Run from shell to be sure , web based query might be faulty </p>
